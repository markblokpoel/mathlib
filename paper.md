# Summary

```mathlib``` is a library for Scala supporting functional programming that resembles
mathematical expressions such as set theory, graph theory and probability theory.
This library was developed to complement the theory development method outlined
in the open education book Theoretical modeling for cognitive science and psychology by @blokpoelandvanrooij:2021.

The goal of this project is to facilitate users to write Scala code that is:

* easy to **read**, because ```mathlib``` syntax closely resembles mathematical notation
* easy to **verify**, by proving that the code exactly implements the theoretical model (or not)
* easy to **sustain**, because newer versions of Scala and ```mathlib``` can run old code (backwards compatibility)
